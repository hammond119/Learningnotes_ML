* Why deep network?
See this [https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/182734/what-is-the-difference-between-a-neural-network-and-a-deep-neural-network?rq=1]
According Universal Approximation Theorem, they are all the same [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_approximation_theorem]
But why deep neutral network get hot?

Somebody claims the shallow network works the same as the deep nets. Then the reason might be that the deep network is easier to train.
